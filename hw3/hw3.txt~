Here is my rewritten prefix sum method that uses loop unrolling and reassociation:

void psum3_v3(float a[], float p[], long n)
{
  long i;
  float acc, val1, val2, val3, val4;
  acc = p[0] = a[0];
  for(i = 1; i < n-3; i+=4)
    {
      val1 = a[i];
      val2 = a[i+1];
      val3 = a[i+2];
      val4 = a[i+3];
      acc += val1;
      p[i] = acc;
      p[i+1] = (acc + val2);
      p[i+2] = (acc + val2 + vval3);
      p[i+3] = (acc += val4);
    }
  for(; i < n; i++)
    {
      p[i] = (acc += a[i]);
    }
}


I actually had multiple different versions of this method, each one with a
